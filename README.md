Respoke SDK for Android
=======================

The Respoke SDK for Android makes it easy to add live voice, video, text, and data features to your mobile app. For information on how to use the SDK, take a look at our developer documentation and sample apps here:

[https://docs.respoke.io/](https://docs.respoke.io/)

Installing the SDK
=============

The Respoke Android SDK is available to install via the Maven Central repository.
You can [download the latest JAR directly](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.digium.respoke%22%20AND%20a%3A%22respoke-sdk%22), or install via Maven:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.digium.respoke</groupId>
    <artifactId>respoke-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>(insert latest version)</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.digium.respoke:respoke-sdk:1.+'
}
```
Building the SDK from source
============================

You must use JDK 1.8.

From the root directory:
```
    ./gradlew build
```

NOTE: The javadoc generation task will complain with errors, but it will still generate the javadoc jar file.

Contributing
============

We welcome pull requests to improve the SDK for everyone. When submitting changes, please make sure you have run the SDK test cases before submitting and added/modified any tests that are affected by your improvements.

Running the SDK test cases
==========================

The SDK test cases require UI elements and so are contained in a test application named "RespokeSDKTest" in this repo. To run the test cases, do the following:


1) Create a Respoke developer account and define a Respoke application in the [developer console](https://portal.respoke.io/#/signup). Make a note of the **application ID** for the Respoke Application you created.

2) Clone this repo onto your development machine.

3) Open Android Studio, choose "Import Project" and select the root directory of the repo.

4) Open RespokeTestCase.java and change the value of the static string `TEST_APP_ID` with the Respoke application ID you received in step 1.

5) Start the web TestBot in either Chrome or Firefox as described in the section "Starting the Web TestBot" below, passing your Respoke application ID as a parameter on the URL.

6) In Android Studio, open the 'Run' menu and select "Edit Configurations". In the upper left corner of the dialog that appears, press the '+' button to create a new run configuration and select 'Android Tests'.

7) Name the new test configuration "All Tests", select the "respokeSDKTest" module from the drop-down box, and choose the settings in the "Target Device" box that make the most sense for your test set up. save the new configuration. You only have to do this once, in the future you can just select the existing configuration to run the tests.

8) Open the "Run" menu again, and choose "debugâ€¦". Select the "All Tests" configuration to run the test cases, displaying the results inside of Android Studio. You will also see debug messages and video displayed in the web browser running the TestBot.

Starting the Web TestBot
========================

The functional test cases that use RespokeCall require a specific Web application based on Respoke.js that is set up to automatically respond to certain actions that the SDK test cases perform. Because the web application will use audio and video, it requires special user permissions from browsers that support WebRTC and typically requires user interaction. Therefore it must run from either the context of a web server, or by loading the html file from the file system with specific command line parameters for Chrome. 

Additionally, the Android Studio test project has been set up to expect that the web application will connect to Respoke with a specific endpoint ID in the following format:

testbot-username

This username is the user that you are logged into your development computer with when you run the tests. This is done to avoid conflicts that can occur when multiple developers are running multiple instances of the test web application simultaneously. 

To set up your system to perform these tests, do one of the following:

#### A) Load the html from a file with Chrome.


1) You can use command line parameters to load the test bot with Chrome tell it to use a fake audio and video source during testing. On Mac OS, the command would look like this:

    $ "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
    --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream \
    --use-fake-device-for-media-stream \
    --allow-file-access-from-files \
    ./WebTestBot/index.html &

2) Once the file has loaded, append your local username and Respoke application ID to the URL to match what Android Studio will search for as the tests run:

    file:///respoke-android-sdk/WebTestBot/index.html#?un=mymacusername&app_id=my-respoke-app-id

3) Run the SDK test cases



#### B) Run with a local web server.


1) Install http-server

    $ sudo npm i -g http-server

2) Start http-server from the testbot directory:

    $ cd WebTestBot/
    $ http-server

3) Start Chrome using command line parameters to use fake audio/video and auto accept media permissions so that no human interaction is required:

    $ /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream --use-fake-device-for-media-stream

This can alternately be done with Firefox by navigating to "about:config" and then setting the "media.navigator.permission.disabled" option to TRUE

4) Open the TestBot in a Chrome tab by loading http://localhost:8080/#?un=mymacusername&app_id=my-respoke-app-id

5) Run the SDK test cases
